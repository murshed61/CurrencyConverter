# CurrencyConverter

What does this program do?
= This program is used to convert a currency to another currency. 
How does it work?
= In this program there are 2 distinct logic and another logic is based on those 2 logic. We used 2 arrays to store data , in one we got all the respective exchange rate relative to USD
like, 1 USD = 109.86 BDT, this array is used to calculate USD to any currency values. In other array, we stored all the USD values in respect to other currencies.
for example, 1 BDT = 0.0091 USD . This is used to calculate any Currency to USD. 
So we got, 2 base covered, USD to ANY currency & ANY to USD currency, for ANY to ANY currency we used those 2 logic. First we took the input currency and used ANY to USD logic
then When we got the USD value, we used USD to ANY logic , where ANY is the currency we are converting to.
Why the project is useful?
= It improves understanding of arrays,and logical thinking. There are multiple ways to tackle this problem so we can always try to improve our efficiency.
